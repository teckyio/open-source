# Tecky Open Source

## What 

Tecky Open Source is a collection of open sourced projects created by our students during their studies in Tecky MicroMaster. These projects are all licensed under MIT License.

## Why

Project ideas are often asked by our students while project implementations are demanded by the community. That is a perfect match to gather ideas from the community and let our students work on those in return.

## I have an idea

Please visit the [Issues page](https://github.com/teckyio/open-source/issues) of this github project and add an idea using the template.

All project idea must fulfill the below criterias:

* Reasonably fit in the 3-week project time for 2-3 bootcamp students
* Agree and be able to license the idea and implementation in MIT License
* Do not require any non-disclosure agreements
* Do not violate any laws of Hong Kong
